What advantage(s) did your non-VPN solution have?



Explain the Solution Requirements

Would a VPN meet the access control requirements you had for Project 1?
How would a VPN protect the network just as well, or better, than your current solution?



Explain the Solution Details

Which Azure tools would you use to implement a VPN to your Project 1 network?
How would you onboard users to the new VPN system?



Identify Advantages and Disadvantages of the Solution


In Project 1, would a VPN have been an appropriate access control solution?


Under what circumstances is a VPN a good solution?


When, if ever, is a VPN "overkill"?
